        Recently, the General Manager of XpertCode SRL requested my reinstatement to join PAC, by its acronym in Spanish it means customer service project, whose mission is to unify the dense cloud of systems that run in the Claro network and that are used in the different customer service centers nationwide.

        During my time in the team, I built considerable improvements in the postpaid suspension modules and the maintenance of some configurations in the administration console.

        As part of the improvements implemented, I worked on the creation of a history of offers, whose data is stored in a cloud solution called Neon, created by a Latin American company called FlyTxT.

Here I built a maintenance to store AWS cloud configurations, I prototyped an HPA strategy based on the Kafka Consumer Lag metric, whereby pods in a namespace can automatically scale or descale, depending on load.

        After that, I've been collaborating with Elsa, an open source library for creating applications based on workflows.
